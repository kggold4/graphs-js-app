# Graphs App (Front-End JavaScript Project)

### This project contains two main parts:

1. Building a library of directed weighted graph data structure and graph theory algorithms (e.g: shortest-path, is-connected and more).
2. Building a graphical user interface that gives to the user to create. remove and modify nodes in the graph and use the graph theory algorithms.
