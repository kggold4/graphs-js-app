# Graphs App (Front-End JavaScript Project)

### This project contains two main parts:

1. Object-Oriented JavaScript library of directed weighted graph data structure and graph theory algorithms (e.g: shortest-path, is-connected and more). - [api](js/api)
2. Graphical user interface that gives to the user the ability to create, remove and modify nodes in the graph and use the graph theory algorithms. - [gui](js/gui)
