# Graphs App (Front-End JavaScript Project)

### This project contains two main parts:

1. Object-Oriented JavaScript library of directed weighted graph data structure and graph theory algorithms (e.g: shortest-path, shortest-distance, is-connected and more) - see the source code at <i>[API](js/api).</i>
2. Graphical user interface that gives to the user the ability to create, remove and modify nodes in the graph and use the graph theory algorithms - see the source code at <i>[GUI](js/gui).</i>
